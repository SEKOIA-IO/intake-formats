  Tenable AD is an automated security solution that monitors the components
  of Active Directory infrastructures by detecting attacks in real
  time, identifying existing weaknesses and vulnerabilities.

  Sending Tenable AD logs to SEKOIA.IO will bring you a better visibility on
  the AD security. Detected AD attacks are contextualized with our
  Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI).
data_sources:
  Application logs: Tenable AD events bring information from Active Directory logs
  Authentication logs: Tenable AD alerts provide details on anomalies/threats detected in authentication logs
  Network protocol analysis: information on LDAP, DNS and Kerberos protocols are collected through Tenable AD logs
