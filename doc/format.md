# Format

## Organization

Format are organized in modules. Each module is associated with a category or, most of the time, a product vendor.

A module is made up of:
- `_meta`, a meta-information directory
- as many sub-directories as formats included in the module

### Module `_meta` directory

This directory holds meta-information about the module.
It hosts two documents:

- A logo that illustrates the module. This logo should help to identify the category or the vendor.

  It must be a PNG image, with transparent background, named `logo.png` and must be lighter than 50Ko.

- a `manifest.yml` document.
  This document must contain an UUID that identifies the module, the name of the module, a short and url-friendly name of the module and a short description that describes the module.
 
  Here is an example from the [AWS Module manifest](../AWS/_meta/manifest.yml).

### Formats

A format is associated to a software technology. In general, a format correspond to a vendor product.

Each format share the same tree structure:
- `_meta`, a meta-information directory
- `ingest/parser.yml`, the parser of the format
- a set of testings files

#### Format `_meta` directory

Like the module one, this directory holds meta-information about the format.
It consists of 4 files:

- A logo that identifies the product. This logo should help identify the product that is represented by the format. 

  It must be a PNG image, with transparent background, named `logo.png` and must be lighter than 50Ko.

- a `manifest.yml` document.
  This document must contain an UUID that identifies the format, the name of the format, a short and url-friendly name, a short description that describes the software technology and a list of [data-sources](datasources.md).
  
  Here is an example from [Trend Micro Deep Security manifest](../Trend%20Micro/deep-security/_meta/manifest.yml)

- A [taxonomy](taxonomy.md) file that describes fields used in the parser.

  For inspiration, see [Windows taxonomy](../Windows/windows/_meta/fields.yml).
  
- Some [smart-descriptions](smart-descriptions.md) (e.g: [Windows smart-descriptions](../Windows/windows/_meta/smart-descriptions.json))


#### Parser

The parser transforms raw event into [structured event](structured_event.md).

It's a vocabulary scheduling how information will be extracted from the raw event.
It consists of a pipeline setting up the sequence of data extraction as well as stages defining the construction of the structured event.

The parser is written in [YAML](https://www.yaml.org) dialect.

Refer to [parser](parser.md) to understand the vocabulary.


#### Test files

To validate the parser, a set of test files should be hosted in the directory `tests` of the format.

See [testing](testing.md) to understand test files and how to validate the parser with them.


## Generation

To generate a new module or a new format, you can use `utils/generate.py` to guide you.

### To generate a new module

Go to the directory `utils` and execute `generate.py` with the command `new-module`. Fill the prompts with requested information.

```shell
$ cd utils
$ poetry install
$ poetry run generate.py new-module
module_name [SEKOIAIO]: My module
module_description [The description of the module]: My first module
module_dir [My module]:
$ 
```

### To generate a new format

Go to the directory `utils` and execute `generate.py` with the command `new-format` with the path to your module as argument. Fill the prompts with requested information.

```shell
$ cd utils
$ poetry run generate.py new-format ../My\ module
intake_name [The name of the intake]: My Format
intake_slug [my-format]:
intake_description [The description of the intake]: My First Format
$ 
```
